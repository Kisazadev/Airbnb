OKay..... Things I need to do

An investor wants to buy real estate in CDMX for the purpose of renting it out as an AirBnB unit...

1. Rankings of avg rent price by neighborhood. Take care of outliers.
    
2. avg rent price over time?
3. avg rent price by unit type
    Avg Price(1447) for entire home/apartment is 2.7x larger than a private room. You'll need at least 3 rooms for private rooms. 
    A hotel room is also an alternative, not a lot of competition. Cannot hold as many people so less attractive but a hotel has ammenities non-luxury buildings cannot provide. 
4. avg amount of units per neighborhood. 

Which neighborhoods have hosts with a greater monopololy. 

So far... it looks like Miguel hidalgo might be the best investment accounting for avg price and amount of units available.
